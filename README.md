# Continual Learning Playground

A playground for experimenting with continual learning algorithms and techniques.

## Overview

This project provides a framework for exploring continual learning methods, including:
- Experience replay
- Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)
- Progressive Neural Networks
- Memory-based approaches

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure
